Flask Principal
===============

*"I am that I am"*


Introduction
------------

Flask-Principal provides a very loose framework to tie in providers of two
types of service, often located in different parts of a web application:

    1. Authentication providers
    2. User information providers

For example, an authentication provider may be oauth, using Flask-OAuth and
the user information may be stored in a relational database. Looseness of
the framework is provided by using signals as the interface.

The major components are the Identity, Needs, Permission, and the IdentityContext.

    1. The Identity represents the user, and is stored/loaded from various
       locations (eg session) for each request. The Identity is the user's
       avatar to the system. It contains the access rights that the user has.

    2. A Need is the smallest grain of access control, and represents a specific
       parameter for the situation. For example "has the admin role", "can edit
       blog posts".

       Needs are any tuple, or probably could be object you like, but a tuple
       fits perfectly. The predesigned Need types (for saving your typing) are
       either pairs of (method, value) where method is used to specify
       common things such as `"role"`, `"user"`, etc. And the value is the
       value. An example of such is `('role', 'admin')`. Which would be a
       Need for a admin role. Or Triples for use-cases such as "The permission
       to edit a particular instance of an object or row", which might be represented
       as the triple `('article', 'edit', 46)`, where 46 is the key/ID for that
       row/object.

       Essentially, how and what Needs are is very much down to the user, and is
       designed loosely so that any effect can be achieved by using custom
       instances as Needs.

       Whilst a Need is a permission to access a resource, an Identity should
       provide a set of Needs that it has access to.

    3. A Permission is a set of requirements, any of which should be
       present for access to a resource.

    4. An IdentityContext is the context of a certain identity against a certain
       Permission. It can be used as a context manager, or a decorator.

        c -> p ;
        i -> n:n1 ;
        i -> n:n2 ;

    }

Protecting access to resources
------------------------------

For users of Flask-Principal (not authentication providers), access
restriction is easy to define as both a decorator and a context manager. A
simple quickstart example is presented with commenting::

    from flask import Flask, Response
    from flask.ext.principal import Principal, Permission, RoleNeed

    app = Flask(__name__)

    # load the extension
    principals = Principal(app)

    # Create a permission with a single Need, in this case a RoleNeed.
    admin_permission = Permission(RoleNeed('admin'))

    # protect a view with a principal for that need
    @app.route('/admin')
    @admin_permission.require()
    def do_admin_index():
        return Response('Only if you are an admin')

    # this time protect with a context manager
    @app.route('/articles')
    def do_articles():
        with admin_permission.require():
            return Response('Only if you are admin')

Authentication providers
------------------------

Authentication providers should use the `identity-changed` signal to indicate
that a request has been authenticated. For example, the following code is a
hypothetical example of how one might combine the popular
`Flask-Login <http://packages.python.org/Flask-Login/>`_  extension with
Flask-Principal::


    from flask import Flask, current_app, request, session
    from flask.ext.login import LoginManager, login_user, logout_user, \
         login_required, current_user
    from flask.ext.wtf import Form, TextField, PasswordField, Required, Email
    from flask.ext.principal import Principal, Identity, AnonymousIdentity, \
         identity_changed

    app = Flask(__name__)

    Principal(app)

    login_manager = LoginManager(app)

    @login_manager.user_loader
    def load_user(userid):
        # Return an instance of the User model
        return datastore.find_user(id=userid)

    class LoginForm(Form):
        email = TextField()
        password = PasswordField()

    @app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def login():
        # A hypothetical login form that uses Flask-WTF
        form = LoginForm()

        # Validate form input
        if form.validate_on_submit():
            # Retrieve the user from the hypothetical datastore
            user = datastore.find_user(email=form.email.data)

            # Compare passwords (use password hashing production)
            if form.password.data == user.password:
                # Keep the user info in the session using Flask-Login
                login_user(user)

                # Tell Flask-Principal the identity changed
                identity_changed.send(current_app._get_current_object(),
                                      identity=Identity(user.id))

                return redirect(request.args.get('next') or '/')

        return render_template('login.html', form=form)

    @app.route('/logout')
    @login_required
    def logout():
        # Remove the user information from the session
        logout_user()

        # Remove session keys set by Flask-Principal
        for key in ('identity_id', 'identity_auth_type'):
            session.pop(key, None)

        # Tell Flask-Principal the user is anonymous
        identity_changed.send(current_app._get_current_object(),
                              identity=AnonymousIdentity())

        return redirect(request.args.get('next') or '/')


User Information providers
--------------------------

User information providers should connect to the `identity-loaded` signal to
add any additional information to the Identity instance such as roles. The
following is another hypothetical example using Flask-Login and could be
combined with the previous example. It shows how one might use a role based
permission scheme::

    from flask.ext.login import current_user
    from flask.ext.principal import identity_loaded, RoleNeed, UserNeed

    @identity_loaded.connect_via(app)
    def on_identity_loaded(sender, identity):
        # Set the identity user object
        identity.user = current_user

        # Add the UserNeed to the identity
        if hasattr(current_user, 'id'):
            identity.provides.add(UserNeed(current_user.id))

        # Assuming the User model has a list of roles, update the
        # identity with the roles that the user provides
        if hasattr(current_user, 'roles'):
            for role in current_user.roles:
                identity.provides.add(RoleNeed(role.name))


Granular Resource Protection
----------------------------

Now lets say, for example, you only want the author of a blog post to be able to
edit said article. This can be achieved by creating the necessary `Need` and
`Permission` objects, and adding more logic into the `identity_loaded` signal
handler. For example::

    from collections import namedtuple
    from functools import partial

    from flask.ext.login import current_user
    from flask.ext.principal import identity_loaded, Permission, RoleNeed, \
         UserNeed

    BlogPostNeed = namedtuple('blog_post', ['method', 'value'])
    EditBlogPostNeed = partial(BlogPostNeed, 'edit')

    class EditBlogPostPermission(Permission):
        def __init__(self, post_id):
            need = EditBlogPostNeed(unicode(post_id))
            super(EditBlogPostPermission, self).__init__(need)

    @identity_loaded.connect_via(app)
    def on_identity_loaded(sender, identity):
        # Set the identity user object
        identity.user = current_user

        # Add the UserNeed to the identity
        if hasattr(current_user, 'id'):
            identity.provides.add(UserNeed(current_user.id))

        # Assuming the User model has a list of roles, update the
        # identity with the roles that the user provides
        if hasattr(current_user, 'roles'):
            for role in current_user.roles:
                identity.provides.add(RoleNeed(role.name))

        # Assuming the User model has a list of posts the user
        # has authored, add the needs to the identity
        if hasattr(current_user, 'posts'):
            for post in current_user.posts:
                identity.provides.add(EditBlogPostNeed(unicode(post.id)))

The next step will be to protect the endpoint that allows a user to edit an
article. This is done by creating a permission object on the fly using the ID
of the resource, in this case the blog post::

    @app.route('/posts/<post_id>', methods=['PUT', 'PATCH'])
    def edit_post(post_id):
        permission = EditBlogPostPermission(post_id)

        if permission.can():
            # Save the edits ...
            return render_template('edit_post.html')

        abort(403)  # HTTP Forbidden
